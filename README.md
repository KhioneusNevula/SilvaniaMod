# SilvaniaMod
The Silvania is an enormous, magical tree home to the magical wood nymphs

WOOD NYMPHS:

<ul>
  <li> Wood Nymphs are simple villager-like mobs; however, they can fly and have magical abilities.
    <li>Wood nymphs path navigate in more or less the same way as ghasts (?)
   <li> Because wood nymphs do not need stairs, players would need other ways to ascend the walls of their silvaniae. Vines might help
     <li>Wood nymphs sleep on bed-branches by hanging upside down from them. 
       <li>Wood nymphs can open doors; however they do not use them and their houses only have permeable curtains in front. 
       <li>Wood nymphs shed wingscales which develop permeable layers on the floor (like snow, but passable except that it slows down travel and has a tiny chance of applying the 'sick' effect)
      <li>Wood nymphs eat plant based items, primarily Sap
  </ul>
  
  SICK:
  
  Sickness is a simple wood nymph mechanic where dirty conditions can cause wood nymphs to develop an effect that deals a tiny amount of damage which increases in frequency the longer the effect is active. It also has a chance of being passed onto other creatures by proximity.
  
ITEMS:
  
* Sap: Sap is a food harvestable by wood nymphs from tree blocks
